# GeniusAI RESTful APIs üåê

This README provides detailed instructions on how to set up, configure, and access the RESTful APIs for GeniusAI, including OAuth2 Passport authentication and API documentation generation.


## REST API Setup üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the RESTful APIs, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

- **PHP**: Version 8.1 or higher
- **Laravel**: Ensure you have Laravel installed and configured
- **MySQL/MariaDB**: Database setup and ready for migrations

### Running Migrations üìã

To prepare your database for OAuth2 Passport integration, you'll need to run the necessary migrations. These migrations will create the tables required for Passport's functionality.

1. **Run Migrations**
   - Navigate to the root of your Laravel project.
   - Execute the following command:
     ```bash
     php artisan migrate
     ```
   - This command will set up the necessary tables in your database.

### OAuth2 Passport Setup üîê

Laravel Passport provides a full OAuth2 server implementation for your Laravel application in a matter of minutes. To set up OAuth2 Passport with Laravel, follow these steps:

1. **Install Passport**
   - From the root of your Laravel project, run:
     ```bash
     composer require laravel/passport
     ```
   - Install Passport by running the following command:
     ```bash
     php artisan passport:install
     ```
   - This command generates the encryption keys needed to generate secure access tokens.

2. **Save Your Credentials**
   - After installation, you'll see `client_id` and `client_secret` values generated in the console.
   - Save these values as you'll need them to access the API endpoints.

3. **Configure Passport in Laravel**
   - Add the `Laravel\Passport\HasApiTokens` trait to your `User` model:
     ```php
     use Laravel\Passport\HasApiTokens;

     class User extends Authenticatable
     {
         use HasApiTokens, Notifiable;
     }
     ```
   - In the `AuthServiceProvider`, register the `Passport` routes within the `boot` method:
     ```php
     use Laravel\Passport\Passport;

     public function boot()
     {
         $this->registerPolicies();

         Passport::routes();
     }
     ```
   - Finally, in your `config/auth.php` file, set the `driver` option of the `api` authentication guard to `passport`:
     ```php
     'guards' => [
         'api' => [
             'driver' => 'passport',
             'provider' => 'users',
         ],
     ],
     ```

That's it! Your OAuth2 Passport setup is now complete. You can now use the `client_id` and `client_secret` to authenticate API requests.

## Generating API Documentation üìë

GeniusAI uses L5-Swagger to generate API documentation. This allows you to automatically document your API endpoints in an easily accessible format.

### Generate Documentation

To generate the Swagger documentation, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Swagger Generator**
   - Navigate to the root of your Laravel project.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     php artisan l5-swagger:generate
     ```
   - This command will generate the Swagger documentation for your API endpoints.

### Accessing the Documentation

Once the documentation is generated, you can access it via your web browser:

1. **Access Documentation**
   - Open your browser and go to:
     ```
     http://your-app-url/api/documentation
     ```
   - Replace `your-app-url` with your actual application URL.

Your API documentation should now be accessible, providing detailed information about each available endpoint, including request and response formats.

## API Endpoint Structure üß©

GeniusAI's API follows RESTful conventions, and the endpoints are organized into resources. Below are examples of the endpoint structures:

- **Authentication**
  - `POST /api/login`: Authenticate and receive a token
  - `POST /api/register`: Register a new user
- **Content Generation**
  - `POST /api/content/text`: Generate text content
  - `POST /api/content/image`: Generate image content
- **Content Analysis**
  - `POST /api/analysis/sentiment`: Perform sentiment analysis on text
  - `POST /api/analysis/plagiarism`: Check for plagiarism in text content
